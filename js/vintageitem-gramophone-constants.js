        "description": "This item would be a great buy for a gramophone enthusiast looking for a restoration project, or could be used as a theatre or stage prop to evoke an early 20th century atmosphere. The gramophone winds up and the turntable spins, and changes speed when the speed regulator is adjusted. When a record is placed on the turntable, the sound is muffled and distorted. The gramophone comes with 9 records from labels such as Brunswick, Parlophone, and Columbia. Included also is a bag of spare needles.",
