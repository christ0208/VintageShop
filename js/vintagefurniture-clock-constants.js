        "year": 2000,
        "description": "A clock with a firm matte look and a solid stunning finish, making it very demanding and attention seeking. It has standard dimensions, due to which it has no issues meeting the buyerÂ’s desires. A lustrous frame adds to its glamour and an indicated non-numeral system makes it unique. Its wands also hold a considerable lustre which is hardly seen in many clocks. It features a simple yet elegant white interface which balances with the lustrous make of its key components. This clock is usually preferred in official as well as domestic or public localities, pertaining to its universally superficial make."
