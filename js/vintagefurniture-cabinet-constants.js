        "description": "This vintage cabinet comes from Dongbei Province in China and dates from circa 1920.

        "title": "Vintage Industrial Cabinet",
        "year": 1920,
        "description": "Our unique and quirky two drawer, two cupboard chest is constructed using the finest steel, cast iron and recycled hardwood. The provenance of this piece is wonderful. The drawer fronts are constructed by hand using pieces of hardwood recovered from dismantled boat wrecks found in Indonesia. The wood even has remnants of the original painted colour of the boat, which in many cases is over 50 years old! Local craftsmen work and treat the wood so that it can be used in these rare and special items, giving the hardwood a second life."
